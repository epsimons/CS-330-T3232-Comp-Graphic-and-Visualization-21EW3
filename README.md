Module Eight Journal
1.	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
1.	I think this class has helped me to visualize work in a 3D space.
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
1.	I tried to use an incremental approach to minimize errors.
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
1.	I feel that the ability to make incremental changes in between testing will be instrumental in my future.
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
1.	I would try to use what resource are there to keep from adding more components. More components can equal more errors.
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
1.	I would add an item, test, then add another.
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
1.	I feel it has forced me to slow down and try to test as I go to minimize errors and allow the ones that crop up to be easier to fix.
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
1.	This definitely gives me a new skillset that can be used in future positions.
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
1.	I feel it does. Every new skillset is something that makes me more marketable.
